Greetings! This is Patrick, currently a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I have had the distinct honor of being under the mentorship of Prof. <a href='https://www.sunlab.org/'>Jimeng Sun</a>, whose guidance has been invaluable to my research in the intersection of AI & Healthcare. I am also glad to have been working with Prof. <a href='http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/'>Jiawei Han</a> for text mining related research, with a special focus on pre-trained language models and knowledge graphs. Prior to my journey at UIUC, I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Waseda University in the vibrant city of Tokyo, Japan where my research was supervised by Profs. <a href='https://www.tei-lab.jp/en/professors/'>Kenji Tei</a> and <a href='https://www.tei-lab.jp/en/professors/'>Kenji Tei</a>.

My primary research interests orbit around 

 * Machine Learning for Healthcare

 * Knowledge Graphs and Graph Neural Networks 

 * Data Mining (especially Text Mining)
